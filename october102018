Chianti wine and jake make the world go around. 
Jake is a term you might not know. Had a hamburger and glass of red wine at 
Central Market. My 4year old West Highland Terrier 
went along for the ride. 

So, here is my story. I am enrolled in Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. I finished the PREWORK_WWD Modules and 
read the recommended Eloquent Javascript 
by Marijn Haverbeke. The book is highly recommended by bootCamp Austin. Bootcamp has 12 lessons with exercises 
which I have had the opportunity to complete. I may not be the sharpest frog in the box, but I have the time and inclination to put 
into this study.
